                          Fresh Tomatoes

  What is it?
  -----------

  This is the first project in Udacity's Nanodegree Program. The project
  includes Python code that will execute on the server-side and compile a
  static HTML page. This page displays movies held in an object with a youtube
  trailer, title, poster image, and other information.
  This particular project compiles modularized HTML that includes Bootstrap and
  AngularJS components. It purposely excludes dynamic/real-time capabilities of
  Angular (causing headaches for the developer) in order to
  demonstrate server-side code's ability to compile and distribute content to
  the client.

  How does it work?
  ------------------

  The main stages of this Python code are the class definition (media.py), class
  instantiations (entertainment_center.py), and the insertion of class data in
  html (fresh_tomatoes.py). Run fresh_tomatoes.py and the site will compile and
  launch a browser.
  There are also files in the (/etc) folder to ease development/modification of
  code, but are not part of the main project.

  Documentation
  -------------

  To run the core of the project (fresh_tomatoes.py), you only need to run
  'python fresh_tomatoes.py' in the terminal, and maintain this file structure:
 >movies/
    |-- precompiled/
    |   |-- precompiled.html
    |   |-- movies.json
    |-- fresh_tomatoes.py
    |-- entertainment_center.py
    |-- media.py

  Installation
  ------------

  All that is needed is Python. The rest will work itself out.
